        LGBTQ
An acronym used to describe les­bian, gay, bisex­u­al, trans­gen­der, queer or ques­tion­ing per­sons or the com­mu­ni­ty. Avoid using the term​“gay com­mu­ni­ty,” as it does not accu­rate­ly account for the community’s diversity.<br>
Grow­ing up can be hard. Grow­ing up iden­ti­fy­ing as les­bian, gay, bisex­u­al, trans­gen­der, queer or ques­tion­ing (LGBTQ) is even hard­er, accord­ing to nation­al data. Also referred to as LGBTQIA+, these terms include les­bian, gay, bisex­u­al, trans, queer, ques­tion­ing, inter­sex, asex­u­al and more identities.<br>

SEX­U­AL AND GEN­DER IDEN­TI­TY TERMS TO KNOW
<br>
<li>Lesbian: Refers to a woman who is attracted to other women.</li>
<li>Gay: Refers to a man who is attracted to other men. It is also used more broadly to describe individuals attracted to the same sex regardless of gender.</li>
<li>Bisexual: Describes individuals who are attracted to both men and women.</li>
<li>Transgender: Refers to individuals whose gender identity differs from the sex assigned to them at birth. For example, a person assigned male at birth may identify as female.</li>
<li>Queer: Originally a term with derogatory connotations, "queer" has been reclaimed by some as an umbrella term for sexual and gender minorities. It can encompass a variety of identities outside of heterosexual and cisgender norms.</li>
<br>TRAN­SI­TION<br>
A com­plex process by which trans­gen­der peo­ple align their anato­my (med­ical tran­si­tion) and gen­der expres­sion (social tran­si­tion) with their gen­der iden­ti­ty. Tran­si­tion­ing is a mul­ti­­ple-step process that occurs over a long peri­od of time. It can include such steps as using a dif­fer­ent name, using new pro­nouns, dress­ing dif­fer­ent­ly, updat­ing legal doc­u­ments, hor­mone ther­a­py and surgery. The exact steps involved in a person’s tran­si­tion varies.
