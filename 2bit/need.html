                ex refers to acts that can sexually arouse you, such as kissing, caressing, fingering, oral. You can have sex with yourself, masturbation.
                 As an activity in which one, two, or more people use words or touch to arouse themselves and/or each other.
                Every person is able to define what a sexual act means to them. Sex might involve touching genitals, but it might not. Sex for somebody might mean cuddling with clothes on or sending a sexy text message. It is essential that every person involved in the sexual activity gets consent from the other people involved before any sexual touching or sexual talking happens.
                There are many reasons two or more people might want to engage in sexual activity with each other. SERC likes to talk about pleasure being at the center of sexual activity; though there are many reasons people may want to engage in sexual activity with each other, it is important that everybody involved feels good in the interaction and consent is present. We like to highlight the idea that sex, sexual touching and sexy talking should feel good and safe for everybody involved.</p>
            
                <h2> Why is it called sex?</h2>
            <p>
                The English word "sex" comes from the Latin word "sexus," which means "state of being male or female" or "sexual division." The Latin term "sexus" itself is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root "*sweḱs-," which signifies "to cut" or "to divide."</p>

            <h2> Reasons for having sex</h2>
